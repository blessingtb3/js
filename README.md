Notes on js


what is js:
JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language primarily used for web development. It enables interactive web pages and runs in the user's browser, allowing for features like dynamic content updates and event-driven interactions. JavaScript supports object-oriented programming and is versatile across platforms. It is based on the ECMAScript standard and has many frameworks and libraries, such as React and Angular, that enhance development. Additionally, it allows for asynchronous programming, making it efficient for handling tasks like API calls. Overall, JavaScript is essential for creating modern web applications.






what can you do with it: 
JavaScript can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

1. **Web Development**: Creating dynamic and interactive web pages by manipulating HTML and CSS.

2. **Front-End Frameworks**: Building single-page applications (SPAs) using frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js.

3. **Back-End Development**: Using Node.js to develop server-side applications and APIs.

4. **Mobile App Development**: Creating mobile applications using frameworks like React Native and Ionic.

5. **Game Development**: Developing browser-based games using libraries like Phaser.

6. **Browser Extensions**: Creating extensions for web browsers to enhance functionality.

7. **Data Visualization**: Using libraries like D3.js to create interactive data visualisations.

8. **Automation**: Writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks in web applications.

9. **Machine Learning**: Implementing machine learning algorithms in the browser using libraries like TensorFlow.js.

10. **Internet of Things (IoT)**: Developing applications that interact with IoT devices.

Overall, JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used in various domains beyond just web development.






What does JavaScript code run:
JavaScript code can run in several environments:

1. **Web Browsers/frontend**: The primary environment, where it enables interactive web pages. - runs on the browser on the js engine in chrome
2. **Server-Side/backend**: Using Node.js for server-side applications and API development. - enables us to run js outside the browser/running locally...
3. **Mobile Devices**: Through frameworks like React Native for cross-platform mobile apps.
4. **Desktop Applications**: With frameworks like Electron to create desktop applications.
5. **IoT Devices**: For programming and controlling Internet of Things devices.

In summary, JavaScript is versatile and can operate in browsers, on servers, in mobile and desktop applications, and on IoT devices.




JavaScript vs ECMAScript:
JavaScript is a high-level programming language used mainly for web development, while ECMAScript is the scripting language specification that defines the core features and syntax of JavaScript. JavaScript implements the ECMAScript standard but also includes additional functionalities and APIs not covered by ECMAScript. In essence, JavaScript is the practical application of the ECMAScript specification.
